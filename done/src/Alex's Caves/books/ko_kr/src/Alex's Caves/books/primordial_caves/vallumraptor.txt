    밸럼랩터는 원시 동굴 안에서 흔히 발견되는, 무리를 지어 사냥하는 공룡입니다. 항상 배회하는 이 짐승들은 이 지역의 금개구리 부터 그로토케라톱스, 심지어 탐험가에 이르기 까지 크고 작은 먹잇감을 잡아먹으려고 듭니다.
    무리가 함께 공격할 때, 이 무시무시한 파충류는 먹잇감을 향해 먼거리를 도약하는 반면, 함께 공격하는 다른 무리들은 난도질하고 물어뜯으며 큰 피해를 입힙니다.
    All Vallumraptor packs are usually led by an Elder, denoted by their orange markings and larger stature. Elders are stronger and have decent armor protection as well. If a Vallumraptor pack loses its Elder in combat, they usually will disperse from battle. Vallumraptors communicate with their pack through their calls.
    Vallumraptors can also open doors and chests using their crafty hands. They will steal any meat items from chests they can find. If a Dinosaur Nugget is taken from a chest by a Vallumraptor, it may enter a relaxed state after consuming it.
    During this relaxed state, the Vallumraptor can be approached and fed a Serene Salad in order to tame it. Tamed Vallumraptors can be made to follow, stay or wander, and are indispensable in combat due to their sneaky abilities.
    If a tamed Vallumraptor loses a lot of its health in battle, it will enter a stealth mode and rapidly begin to heal, only to re-enter combat once safely recovered.
    Tamed Vallumraptors can be bred with a Dinosaur Nugget, and will lay a clutch of eggs afterwards. Baby Vallumraptors that hatch nearby will imprint on their parent's owners.
